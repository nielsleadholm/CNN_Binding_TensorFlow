# CNN_Binding

TensorFlow Core implementation of 'hierarchical feature binding' in convolutional neural networks, and support code to evaluate adversarial vulnerability. 
For information on hierarchical feature binding, see our paper [Hierarchical binding in convolutional neural networks: Making adversarial attacks geometrically challenging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608022002593), Leadholm and Stringer, 2022
